        "Let's consider an example:\n",
        "The heights of the buildings are represented as an array, where each element of the array is the height of a building. For example, `[3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 5]` represents a row of six buildings, where the height of the first building is 3, the second is 0 (no building), and so on.\n",

        "   - Iterate through the array, calculating the highest building up to that point from both the left and the right.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Time Complexity:\n",
        "\n",
        "   The key operations in the algorithm are the two passes through the array to calculate the `left_max` and `right_max` arrays, followed by a third pass to calculate the `water_collected`. Each of these passes takes linear time relative to the length of the input array.\n",

        "   - Third pass to calculate the total water collected: O(n).\n",

        "2. Space Complexity:\n",
        "\n",
